## What it is

Native iOS, Android, and macOS browser apps paired with a Node.js CLI. Language models discover devices on the local network, then control them: navigate, screenshot, read DOM, click, fill forms, scroll, capture network traffic, evaluate JS. Works on real devices, simulators, and emulators. AirPlay an iPhone to an Apple TV and it appears as a second controllable device.

No emulators pretending to be phones. No persistent content scripts. No browser extensions. Real browsers on real hardware, fully controllable by LLMs.

## Status

| Target | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| iOS | Done | Main mobile platform, actively usable |
| Android | Done | Main mobile platform, actively usable |
| macOS | Done | Desktop app is usable |
| Linux | In progress | Desktop shell exists, still evolving |
| Windows | Not done | Very much a work in progress. Not even worth launching yet |
| CLI | Done | Main control surface for devices |

## Install

```
npm install -g @unlikeotherai/kelpie
```

Published releases also attach Android artifacts plus Linux `.tar.gz`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, and `.AppImage` downloads. GitHub Pages publishes Linux package repositories for `apt` and `dnf` from the same release flow.

## Quick start

1. Build and run the iOS or Android app on a device or simulator
2. `kelpie discover` — lists all Kelpie instances on your network
3. `kelpie navigate --url https://example.com` — or connect your LLM via MCP

## Key features

- **Real browsers** — WKWebView (iOS/macOS), CEF (macOS), Android WebView, with native user agents
- **Apple TV support** — AirPlay from iPhone/iPad to Apple TV, TV appears as a separate controllable device
- **mDNS discovery** — devices advertise `_kelpie._tcp`, CLI auto-discovers them
- **HTTP + MCP API** — navigate, screenshot, DOM, click, fill, scroll, JS eval
- **Group commands** — send commands to all devices simultaneously
- **Annotated screenshots** — numbered labels on interactive elements for visual-first automation
- **Safari / Chrome auth** — one-tap login using saved passwords, cookies sync back
- **Network inspector** — capture XHR and fetch traffic with headers, bodies, timing
- **Console capture** — read console output and JS errors with stack traces

## Sister projects

### [AppReveal](https://github.com/UnlikeOtherAI/AppReveal)

Kelpie uses AppReveal only for debug automation. The CLI helper and the in-app library are separate things, and the in-app SDK must never ship in release builds. See [docs.md](docs.md).
